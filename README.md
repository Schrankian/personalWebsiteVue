# Website Portfolio

This is my website portfolio which I coded with the help of Vue.js. I put a lot of effort in it and made it fully responsive which was a lot of work, because this was the first time I developed for web. You can get yourself some inspiration from it, but please mention me if you copy a lot of code.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
